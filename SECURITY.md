## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Email **kile.bantick@gmail.com** with:

1. A description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Potential impact
4. Any suggested mitigations

You'll receive an acknowledgement within 48 hours and a status update within 7 days.

## Scope

The following are in scope:

- **Credential exposure** — API keys, bot tokens, or chat IDs leaking to logs, disk, or the network
- **Telegram authorization bypass** — sending prompts to the extension without being the authorised chat ID
- **Command injection** — unsanitised input reaching the Claude Code / Codex CLI invocation
- **Webview CSP bypass** — content security policy violations in the extension webview
- **Arbitrary code execution** — any path that lets a crafted response from an AI provider execute code outside the intended provider boundary

## Out of Scope

- Vulnerabilities in Claude Code CLI, Codex CLI, or the Telegram platform itself
- Social engineering or phishing attacks
- Issues requiring physical access to the machine

## Security Design Notes

### Credentials

- API keys and bot tokens are stored in VS Code's `SecretStorage` (OS keychain), never in `globalState` or settings JSON
- Telegram chat ID is validated on every inbound message — unknown senders are silently dropped

### Telegram Bridge

- The bot only responds to the single authorised `chatId` configured in settings
- Slash commands from Telegram are validated against an allowlist before dispatch
- Voice messages are transcribed locally via Whisper; no audio is sent to third-party services beyond what the configured AI provider requires

### Webview

- The webview runs with a strict Content Security Policy
- All data passed from the extension host to the webview is serialised through `postMessage` — no `eval`, no `innerHTML` with unsanitised content
- Nonces are regenerated per webview panel instantiation

### AI Provider Output

- Responses from Claude Code / Codex are treated as untrusted content in the webview (rendered as text, not HTML)

### CLI Permission Model

- Both backing CLIs are always spawned with their own built-in approval/sandbox prompts disabled: Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, Codex with `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. This is intentional and always on — the extension itself is the trust boundary (you already trust it to run in your workspace), not the CLI's own per-action confirmation dialogs, which would otherwise block every file edit and shell command behind a native prompt the webview can't intercept
- This means both agents can read, write, and execute in the configured working directory without an extra confirmation step. Anyone reviewing this extension's threat model should treat "an agent turn" as having the same file/process access as running `claude` or `codex` directly from a terminal in that folder — RokketWrapper adds no additional sandboxing on top of the CLI
- Tool call results are displayed as plain text summaries, not executed
